This circular fashion is known as&nbsp;biogeochemical cycling&nbsp;(bio for living; geo for atmosphere).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Among the most important nutrient cycles are the carbon nutrient cycle and the nitrogen nutrient cycle.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>There are many other nutrient cycles that are important in ecology, including a large number of trace mineral nutrient cycles.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h1>Nutrient Cycles<\/h1>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Based on the replacement period, a nutrient cycle is referred to as Perfect or Imperfect cycle.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>A perfect nutrient cycle is one in which nutrients are replaced as fast as they are utilized. Most&nbsp;gaseous cyclesare generally considered as perfect cycles.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>In contrast&nbsp;sedimentary cycles&nbsp;are considered relatively imperfect, as some nutrients are lost from the cycle and get locked into sediments and so become unavailable for immediate cycling.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Based on the nature of the reservoir, there are two types of cycles namely-<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Gaseous Cycle&nbsp;\u2014 where the reservoir is the&nbsp;atmosphere or the hydrosphere&nbsp;\u2014 water cycle, carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, etc. and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Sedimentary Cycle&nbsp;\u2014 where the reservoir is the&nbsp;earth\u2019s crust&nbsp;[elements mostly found in earth\u2019s crust] \u2014 phosphorous cycle, sulphur cycle, calcium cycle, magnesium cycle etc.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<h1>Carbon Cycle [Gaseous Cycle]<\/h1>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Carbon is a minor constituent of the atmosphere as compared to oxygen and nitrogen.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>However, without carbon dioxide life could not exist because it is vital for the production of carbohydrates through photosynthesis by plants.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>It is the element that anchors all organic substances from coal and oil to DNA (deoxyribonudeic acid: the compound that carries genetic information).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Carbon is present in the atmosphere, mainly in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Carbon cycle involves a continuous exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and organisms.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Carbon from the atmosphere moves to green plants by the process of&nbsp;photosynthesis, and then to animals.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>By process of&nbsp;respiration&nbsp;and&nbsp;decomposition&nbsp;of dead organic matter it returns back to atmosphere. It is usually a short term cycle.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Some carbon also enters a long term cycle. It accumulates as un-decomposed organic matter in the peaty layers of marshy soil or as insoluble carbonates in bottom sediments of aquatic systems which take a long time to be released.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>In deep oceans such carbon can remained buried for millions of years till geological movement may lift these rocks above sea level. These rocks may be exposed to erosion, releasing their carbon dioxide, carbonates and bicarbonates into streams and rivers.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Fossil fuels such as coals, oil and natural gas etc. are organic compounds that were buried before they could be decomposed and were subsequently transformed by time and geological processes into fossil fuels. When they are burned the carbon stored in them is released back into the atmosphere as carbon-dioxide.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h1>Nitrogen Cycle [Gaseous Cycle]<\/h1>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Apart from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, nitrogen is the most prevalent element in living organisms.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Nitrogen is a constituent of&nbsp;amino acids, proteins, hormones, chlorophylls&nbsp;and many of the&nbsp;vitamins.

With the loss of these compounds, soil fertility declines. Also, soils become significantly more acidic.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThe main component of the nitrogen cycle starts with the element nitrogen in the air. Two nitrogen oxides are found in the air as a result of interactions with oxygen. Nitrogen will only react with oxygen in the presence of high temperatures and pressures found near&nbsp;lightning bolts&nbsp;and in combustion reactions in power plants or internal combustion engines. Nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO2, are formed under these conditions. Eventually nitrogen dioxide may react with water in rain to form&nbsp;nitric acid, HNO3. The nitrates thus formed may be utilized by plants as a nutrient (so, soil gets nitrogen from acid rain).\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, soil gets nitrogen from acid rain.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>From this, I feel Burning of coal by man adds nitrogen to soil but indirectly though acid rain.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer depends on how you interpret the question.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Phosphorus Cycle [Sedimentary cycle]<\/h1>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Phosphorus plays a central role in aquatic ecosystems and water quality.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Unlike carbon and nitrogen, which come primarily from the atmosphere, phosphorus occurs in large amounts as a mineral in phosphate rocks and enters the cycle from erosion and mining activities.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>This is the nutrient considered to be the main cause of excessive growth of rooted and free-floating microscopic plants (phytoplankton) in lakes [Eutrophication].<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The main storage for phosphorus is in the earth\u2019s crust.

Most\u00a0gaseous cyclesare generally considered as perfect cycles.<\/li>\n<li>In contrast\u00a0sedimentary cycles\u00a0are considered relatively imperfect, as some nutrients are lost from the cycle and get locked into sediments and so become unavailable for immediate cycling.<\/li>\n<\/ol><ul><li>Based on the nature of the reservoir, there are two types of cycles namely-<\/li>\n<\/ul><ol><li>Gaseous Cycle\u00a0\u2014 where the reservoir is the\u00a0atmosphere or the hydrosphere\u00a0\u2014 water cycle, carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, etc. and<\/li>\n<li>Sedimentary Cycle\u00a0\u2014 where the reservoir is the\u00a0earth\u2019s crust\u00a0[elements mostly found in earth\u2019s crust] \u2014 phosphorous cycle, sulphur cycle, calcium cycle, magnesium cycle etc.<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>Carbon Cycle [Gaseous Cycle]<\/p>\n<ul><li>Carbon is a minor constituent of the atmosphere as compared to oxygen and nitrogen.<\/li>\n<li>However, without carbon dioxide life could not exist because it is vital for the production of carbohydrates through photosynthesis by plants.<\/li>\n<li>It is the element that anchors all organic substances from coal and oil to DNA (deoxyribonudeic acid: the compound that carries genetic information).<\/li>\n<li>Carbon is present in the atmosphere, mainly in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2).<\/li>\n<li>Carbon cycle involves a continuous exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and organisms.<\/li>\n<li>Carbon from the atmosphere moves to green plants by the process of\u00a0photosynthesis, and then to animals.<\/li>\n<li>By process of\u00a0respiration\u00a0and\u00a0decomposition\u00a0of dead organic matter it returns back to atmosphere. It is usually a short term cycle.<\/li>\n<li>Some carbon also enters a long term cycle. It accumulates as un-decomposed organic matter in the peaty layers of marshy soil or as insoluble carbonates in bottom sediments of aquatic systems which take a long time to be released.<\/li>\n<li>In deep oceans such carbon can remained buried for millions of years till geological movement may lift these rocks above sea level. These rocks may be exposed to erosion, releasing their carbon dioxide, carbonates and bicarbonates into streams and rivers.<\/li>\n<li>Fossil fuels such as coals, oil and natural gas etc. are organic compounds that were buried before they could be decomposed and were subsequently transformed by time and geological processes into fossil fuels. When they are burned the carbon stored in them is released back into the atmosphere as carbon-dioxide.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Nitrogen Cycle [Gaseous Cycle]<\/p>\n<ul><li>Apart from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, nitrogen is the most prevalent element in living organisms.<\/li>\n<li>Nitrogen is a constituent of\u00a0amino acids, proteins, hormones, chlorophylls\u00a0and many of the\u00a0vitamins.

Acidic rain is a complex mixture of nitrous, nitric, sulfurous and sulfuric acids which all combine to lower the pH.<\/p>\n<p>But, the question says \u201cWhich of the following adds\/add nitrogen to the\u00a0soil?\u201d<\/p>\n<ol><li>Animal Waste like Urea, Uric acid and Death of vegetation add nitrogen in the form of nitrates directly into soil.<\/li>\n<li>Coal combustion ads nitrogen to atmosphere and from there it falls back to earth in the form of acid rain and acid rain adds nitrogen to soil.<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>\u201cThe release of nitric oxides into the air in large quantities causes\u00a0smog and acid rain\u00a0that pollutes the atmosphere, soil and water and affects plants and animals. The increase in nitrogen and nitrous oxide is caused by automobiles, power plants and a wide variety of industries.<\/p>\n<p>As nitrous oxides filter into soil, it loses nutrients like calcium and potassium, which are essential for maintaining a balance in plant ecosystems. With the loss of these compounds, soil fertility declines. Also, soils become significantly more acidic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe main component of the nitrogen cycle starts with the element nitrogen in the air. Two nitrogen oxides are found in the air as a result of interactions with oxygen. Nitrogen will only react with oxygen in the presence of high temperatures and pressures found near\u00a0lightning bolts\u00a0and in combustion reactions in power plants or internal combustion engines. Nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO2, are formed under these conditions. Eventually nitrogen dioxide may react with water in rain to form\u00a0nitric acid, HNO3. The nitrates thus formed may be utilized by plants as a nutrient (so, soil gets nitrogen from acid rain).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So, soil gets nitrogen from acid rain.<\/p>\n<p>From this, I feel Burning of coal by man adds nitrogen to soil but indirectly though acid rain.<\/p>\n<p>The answer depends on how you interpret the question.<\/p>\n<p>Phosphorus Cycle [Sedimentary cycle]<\/p>\n<ul><li>Phosphorus plays a central role in aquatic ecosystems and water quality.<\/li>\n<li>Unlike carbon and nitrogen, which come primarily from the atmosphere, phosphorus occurs in large amounts as a mineral in phosphate rocks and enters the cycle from erosion and mining activities.<\/li>\n<li>This is the nutrient considered to be the main cause of excessive growth of rooted and free-floating microscopic plants (phytoplankton) in lakes [Eutrophication].<\/li>\n<li>The main storage for phosphorus is in the earth\u2019s crust. On land phosphorus is usually found in the form of\u00a0phosphates.<\/li>\n<li>By the process of weathering and erosion phosphates enter rivers and streams that transport them to the ocean.<\/li>\n<li>In the ocean phosphorus accumulates on continental shelves in the form of insoluble deposits.<\/li>\n<li>After millions of years, the crustal plates rise from the sea floor and expose the phosphates on land.<\/li>\n<li>After more time, weathering will release them from rock and the cycle\u2019s geochemical phase begins again.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Sulphur Cycle [Sedimentary cycle]<\/p>\n<ul><li>The sulphur reservoir is in the soil and sediments where it is locked in organic (coal, oil and peat) and inorganic deposits (pyrite rock and sulphur rock) in the form of\u00a0sulphates, sulphides\u00a0and\u00a0organic sulphur.<\/li>\n<li>It is released by weathering of rocks, erosional runoff and decomposition of organic matter and is carried to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in salt solution.<\/li>\n<li>The sulphur cycle is mostly sedimentary except two of its compounds \u2013\u00a0hydrogen sulphide\u00a0(H2S)\u00a0and\u00a0sulphur dioxide (SO2)\u00a0which add a\u00a0gaseous component.<\/li>\n<li>Sulphur enters the atmosphere from several sources like\u00a0volcanic eruptions, combustion\u00a0of fossil fuels (coal, diesel etc.), from\u00a0surface of ocean\u00a0and from\u00a0gases released by decomposition.
