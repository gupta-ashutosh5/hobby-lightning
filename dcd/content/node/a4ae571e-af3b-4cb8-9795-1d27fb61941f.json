The most important climatic factors are temperature and precipitation.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Tundra Biome<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>There are two types of tundra \u2013 arctic and alpine.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Distribution<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Arctic tundra extends as a continuous belt below the polar ice cap and above the tree line (taiga) in the northern hemisphere.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>It occupies the northern fringe of Canada, Alaska, European Russia, Siberia and island group of Arctic Ocean.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>On the south pole, tundra is very small since most of it is covered by ocean.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Alpine tundra occurs at high mountains above the tree line. E.g. High ranges of Himalayas, Andes, Alps etc.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Temperature<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The tundra climate is characterized by a very&nbsp;<strong>low mean annual temperature<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>In mid-winter temperatures are as low as 40 \u2013 50 \u00b0C below freezing.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Precipitation<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Precipitation is mainly in the form of snow and sleet.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Natural Vegetation<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>There are&nbsp;<strong>no trees<\/strong>&nbsp;in the tundra (Ground is frozen). Lowest form of vegetation like&nbsp;<strong>mosses, lichens<\/strong>&nbsp;are found here and there.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Coastal lowlands support hardy grasses and the reindeer moss which provide the only pasturage for&nbsp;<strong>reindeers<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>In the brief summer, berry-bearing bushes and Arctic flowers bloom.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>In the summer, birds migrate north to prey on the numerous&nbsp;<strong>insects<\/strong>&nbsp;which emerge when the snow thaws.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Insects have short life cycles which are completed during favourable period of the year.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Animals like the&nbsp;<strong>reindeer, arctic fox,&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>wolves, musk-ox, polar bear, lemming, arctic hare, arctic willow<\/strong>&nbsp;live in tundra region.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Reptiles and amphibians are almost absent.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Most of the animals have long life e.g. arctic willow has a life span of 150 to 300 years.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>They are protected from chillness by the presence of&nbsp;<strong>thick cuticle<\/strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>epidermal hair<\/strong>&nbsp;or fur.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Mammals of the tundra region have&nbsp;<strong>large body size and small tail and ear to avoid the loss of heat from the surface&nbsp;<\/strong>[less surface area = less heat loss = less food required to produce heat].<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Taiga or Boreal Biome<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Temperature<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Summers are brief and warm reaching 20-25 \u00b0C whereas winters are long and brutually cold \u2013 30-40 \u00b0C below freezing.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Precipitation<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Typical annual precipitation ranges from 38 cm to 63 cm.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>It is quite&nbsp;<strong>well distributed throughout the year<\/strong>, with a&nbsp;<strong>summer maxima<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>In winter the precipitation is in the form of snow.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Soil<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Boreal forest soils are characterized by thin&nbsp;<strong>podozols<\/strong>&nbsp;and are rather poor.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>This is because the weathering of rocks proceeds slowly in cold environments and because the litter derived from conifer needle (leaf) is decomposed very slowly and is not rich in nutrients. Moreover conifers don not shed their leaves frequently.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Most podzols are poor soils for agriculture due to the&nbsp;<strong>sandy<\/strong>&nbsp;portion, resulting in a&nbsp;<strong>low level of moisture and nutrients<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Some are sandy and excessively drained. Others have shallow rooting zones and poor drainage due to subsoil cementation.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>A&nbsp;<strong>low pH (acidic)<\/strong>&nbsp;further compounds issues, along with phosphate deficiencies and aluminium toxicity.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The low pH (acidic) factor is due to&nbsp;<strong>excessive leaching of alkaline oriented cations<\/strong>&nbsp;which if present would neutralize the organic acids of the accumulating litter.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Natural Vegetation<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The predominant vegetation is&nbsp;<strong>evergreen coniferous forest<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Conifers are evergreen plant species such as Spruce, fir and pine trees, etc.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The conifers require little moisture are best suited to this type of sub-Arctic climate.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The productivity and community stability of a boreal forest are&nbsp;<strong>lower<\/strong>&nbsp;than those of any other forest ecosystem.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Animals found in this region include Siberian tiger, wolverine, lynx, wolf, bear, red fox, squirrel, and amphibians like Hyla, Rana, etc.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Characteristics of Coniferous forests<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Unlike the equatorial rain forests, Coniferous forests are of&nbsp;<strong>moderate density&nbsp;<\/strong>and are more uniform. The trees in coniferous forests grow straight and tall.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Almost all conifers are&nbsp;<strong>evergreen<\/strong>. There is no annual replacement of new leaves as in deciduous trees.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The same leaf remains on the tree for as long as&nbsp;<strong>five years<\/strong>. Food is stored in the&nbsp;<strong>trunks<\/strong>, and the&nbsp;<strong>bark is thick<\/strong>&nbsp;to protect the trunk from excessive cold.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Conifers are conical in shape. Their conical shape and sloping branches prevent snow accumulation. It also offers little grip to the winds.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Transpiration<\/strong>&nbsp;can be quite rapid in the warm summer. So, leaves are small, thick,&nbsp;<strong>leathery<\/strong>&nbsp;and needle-shaped&nbsp;<strong>to check excessive transpiration.<\/strong><\/li>\r\n\t<li>The soils of the coniferous forests are They are excessively&nbsp;<strong>leached<\/strong>&nbsp;and very&nbsp;<strong>acidic<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Humus content is also low as the evergreen leaves barely fall and the rate of decomposition is slow.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Under-growth is negligible because of the poor soil conditions.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Absence of direct sunlight and the short duration of summer are other contributory factors.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Coniferous forests are also found in regions with high elevation [Example: The forests just below the snowline in Himalayas].<\/li>\r\n\t<li>But on very steep slopes where soils are immature or non-existent, even the conifer cannot survive [Example: Southern slopes of Greater Himalayas].<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Temperate Deciduous Biome [North Western Europe]<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Moderately warm summers and fairly mild winters.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Temperature<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The mean annual temperatures are usually between 5\u00b0 C and 15\u00b0 C.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Winters are&nbsp;<strong>abnormally mild<\/strong>. This is because of the warming effect brought by&nbsp;<strong>warm North Atlantic Drift. [Eastern Australian warm current in case of New Zealand]<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Precipitation<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Rainfall occurs throughout the year with winter maxima<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Adequate rainfall throughout the year.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Seasons<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>As in other temperate regions there are&nbsp;<strong>four distinct seasons<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Winter is the season of cloudy skies, foggy and misty mornings, and many rainy days from the passing depressions. (Trees shed their leaved in winter to prevent snow accumulation and protect themselves from severe cold)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Spring is the driest and the&nbsp;<strong>most refreshing<\/strong>&nbsp;season when people emerge from the depressing winter to see everything becoming green again.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>This is followed by the long, sunny summer.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Next is the autumn with the roar of gusty winds; and the cycle repeats itself.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>This type of climate with its four distinct seasons is something that is&nbsp;<strong>conspicuously absent in the tropics.&nbsp;<\/strong>[Rainforest == Only Rainy season, Tropical Monsoon == Summer, Winter and Rainy, Tropical Savanna == Summer (rains) and Winter]<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Natural Vegetation<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Soils of temperate forests are podozolic and fairly deep.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The natural vegetation of this climatic type is&nbsp;<strong>deciduous forest.<\/strong><\/li>\r\n\t<li>The trees shed their leaves in the&nbsp;<strong>cold season.<\/strong><\/li>\r\n\t<li>This is an adaptation for protecting themselves against the winter snow and frost.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Shedding begins in&nbsp;<strong>autumn, the \u2018fall\u2019 season<\/strong>. Growth begins in spring.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Some of the common species include&nbsp;<strong>oak, elm, ash, birch, beech, and poplar<\/strong>.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>In the wetter areas grow willows (Light weight cricket bats are made from willows.
